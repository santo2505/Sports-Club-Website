<p><h1>HOCKEY</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to maneuver a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using a 
hockey stick. There are many types of hockey such as bandy, field hockey and ice hockey.Often one variation of the sport, such as field hockey or ice hockey, will 
predominate in a certain area and be known simply as "hockey".</p>
                     <p>  The first recorded use of the word hockey is in the 1773 book Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author:
 Including a New Mode of Infant Education by Richard Johnson (Pseud. Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled "New Improvements on the Game of Hockey".The
 belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by King Edward III of England is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in
 Latin and explicitly forbade the games "Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam". The English historian and biographer John Strype 
did not use the word "hockey" when he translated the proclamation in 1720.The word hockey itself is of unknown origin. One supposition is that it is a derivative of
 hoquet, a Middle French word for a shepherd's stave. The curved, or "hooked" ends of the sticks used for hockey would indeed have resembled these staves. Another
 supposition derives from the known use of cork bungs, (stoppers) in place of wooden balls to play the game. The stoppers came from barrels containing "hock" ale, 
also called "hocky".</p>
