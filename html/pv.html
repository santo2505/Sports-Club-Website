<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>"Pusarla Venkata Sindhu" </b>(born 5 July 1995) is an Indian professional badminton player.
She became the first Indian woman to win an <b>Olympic silver medal</b>, and one of the two Indian badminton players to ever win an Olympic medal Â– other being Saina Nehwal.
She was also a silver medalist at the 2017 <b>BWF World Championships</b>.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sindhu came to international attention when she broke into the top 20 of the<i> BWF World Ranking in September 2012 </i>at the age of 17.
In 2013, she became the first ever Indian women's singles player to win a medal at the Badminton World Championships. 
In March 2015, she is the recipient of India's fourth highest civilian honor, the <i>"Padma Shri"</i>.
Her silver medal win in the women's singles event of the 2016 Summer Olympics made her the first Indian shuttler to reach the final of an Olympics badminton event and the youngest Indian to make a podium finish in an individual event at the Olympics. 
She is among the top five shuttlers in women's singles category.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Pusarla Venkata Sindhu</b> was born in a <i>"Hindu Brahmin family"</i> to <i>.P. V. Ramana of Nirmal</i>, Adilabad district and <i>P. Vijaya </i>of Vijayawada, Krishna district.
 She lives in Hyderabad. In 2000, Ramana was awarded Arjuna Award for his sport.Though her parents played professional volleyball, Sindhu chose badminton over it because she drew inspiration from the success of <i>"Pullela Gopichand"</i>, the 2001 All England Open Badminton Champion.
She eventually started playing badminton from the age of eight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gopichand seconded this correspondent's opinion when he said that <i>"the most striking feature in Sindhu's game is her attitude and the never-say-die spirit"</i>.
After joining Gopichand's badminton academy, Sindhu won several titles.
 In the under-10 years category, she won the 5th Servo All India ranking championship in the doubles category and the singles title at the Ambuja Cement All India ranking.
 In the under-13 years category, Sindhu won the singles title at the Sub-juniors in Pondicherry, doubles titles at the Krishna Khaitan All India Tournament, IOC All India Ranking, the Sub-Junior Nationals and the All India Ranking in Pune.
 She also won the under-14 team gold medal at the 51st National School Games in India.
