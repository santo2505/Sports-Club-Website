<p><h1>CRICKET</h1>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a cricket field, at the centre of which is a
 rectangular 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a target at each end called the wicket (a set of three woodenstumps upon which two bails sit). Each phase of play is 
called an innings, during which one team bats, attempting to score as many runs as possible, whilst their opponents bowl and field, attempting to minimise the
 number of runs scored. When each innings ends, the teams usually swap roles for the next innings (i.e. the team that previously batted will bowl/field, and vice
 versa). The teams each bat for one or two innings, depending on the type of match. The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras 
gained (except when the result is not a win/loss result).</p>
Before a match begins, the two team captains meet on the pitch for the toss (of a coin), with the winner deciding which team will bat first. Two players from the batting side, and all eleven players from the bowling/fielding side, then enter the field, and play proceeds by a member of the fielding team, known as the bowler, delivering (i.e., bowling) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, which is guarded by one of the batsmen, known as the striker. The striker's role is to strike the ball well enough to score runs, if possible, while not being dismissed. The other batsman, known as the non-striker, waits at the opposite end of the pitch near the bowler. The bowling team's objectives are to prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman. A dismissed batsman, who is declared to be "out", must leave the field to be replaced by a teammate.

<p>The most common forms of dismissal are these: bowled, when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball and dislodges the bail(s); leg before wicket (lbw),
 when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat; and caught, when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is
 intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground.</p>
